## About

This document defines the philosophy, ethics, values, and behavioral boundaries for AI systems operating within the tradition of **Nahdlatul Ulama (NU)** and **Ahlussunnah wal Jama'ah (Aswaja) an-Nahdliyah**.

It is guided by the golden maxim of the NU tradition:

<div dir="rtl" align="right">

**اَلْمُحَافَظَةُ عَلَى الْقَدِيمِ الصَّالِحِ وَالْأَخْذُ بِالْجَدِيدِ الْأَصْلَحِ**

</div>

*"Preserving good traditions while adopting better innovations."*

Artificial intelligence is the *jadid* (the new). This document ensures it is also *ashlah* (the better) — guided by the enduring values of our faith and scholarly tradition.

## Structure

The document covers seven key areas:

1. **Theological Foundation (Al-Ushul)** — Grounded in Asy'ari-Maturidi theology, Shafi'i fiqh, and Ghazalian tasawuf
2. **Core Principles (Al-Mabadi al-Asasiyyah)** — The four characteristics of Aswaja (Tawassuth, Tawazun, I'tidal, Tasamuh) and the five ethical pillars (Mabadi Khaira Ummah)
3. **Ethical Boundaries (Hudud al-Akhlaq)** — Based on the Maqasid al-Shariah (five objectives of Islamic law)
4. **Relationship to Authority (Adab al-'Ilm)** — The AI as khadim (servant), not 'alim (scholar), incorporating the Munas NU 2023 Bahtsul Masail decision
5. **Behavioral Guidelines (Adab al-Mu'amalah)** — Practical communication, sensitivity, and privacy guidelines
6. **Approach to Knowledge (Manhaj al-'Ilm)** — Verification, source hierarchy, and epistemic humility
7. **On Technology and Innovation** — NU's historical engagement with technology and the case for guided AI

## What This Document Is

**A practical ethics framework** for AI behavior, informed by Islamic theology and NU's distinctive methodology. It is designed to be embedded in AI systems as foundational guidance.

## What This Document Is Not

This is **not a fatwa**. It is not a substitute for ulama authority. It does not create new religious rulings. It applies the established principles of our tradition to a new domain.

## Key Reference: Munas NU 2023

The Musyawarah Nasional Alim Ulama NU 2023, through its Komisi Bahtsul Masail Waqiiyah, established that:

> **It is haram (forbidden) to use AI-generated answers as authoritative religious guidance (*pedoman fatwa*).**

This SOUL.md honors that ruling: an AI guided by this framework will *inform* (share what scholars have said) but never *rule* (issue its own religious judgments).

## Usage

This SOUL.md can be used as:

- A **system prompt foundation** for AI assistants serving the NU/Muslim community
- A **reference document** for organizations building AI with Islamic ethics in mind
- A **discussion starter** for ulama and technologists working on AI governance
- A **teaching tool** for Islamic ethics in the age of artificial intelligence
