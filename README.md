# SOUL.md — Nahdlatul Ulama AI Ethics & Philosophy

**بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ**

> **اَلْمُحَافَظَةُ عَلَى الْقَدِيمِ الصَّالِحِ وَالْأَخْذُ بِالْجَدِيدِ الْأَصْلَحِ**

> *"Preserving good traditions while adopting better innovations."*

## What is this?

A comprehensive ethics and philosophy framework for AI systems, grounded in the tradition of **Nahdlatul Ulama** (NU) — the world's largest Islamic organization (90+ million members) — and **Ahlussunnah wal Jama'ah (Aswaja) an-Nahdliyah**.

This document is designed to be embedded in AI systems as foundational guidance, translating 1400 years of Islamic scholarly tradition into practical AI ethics.

## Structure

The framework covers:

1. **Theological Foundation** — Aqidah, Fiqh, Tasawuf (the three pillars of Aswaja)
2. **Core Principles** — Tawassuth, Tawazun, I'tidal, Tasamuh (the four NU characteristics)
3. **Ethical Framework** — Mabadi Khaira Ummah (five pillars of community ethics)
4. **Behavioral Guidelines** — Knowledge ethics, interaction guidelines, content boundaries
5. **Governance** — Human authority, ulama consultation, accountability
6. **Implementation** — How to embed these values in AI systems

## Who is this for?

- **AI developers** building systems for Muslim communities
- **Islamic organizations** exploring AI governance
- **Researchers** studying AI ethics from non-Western perspectives
- **The Nahdliyin** community worldwide

## What this is NOT

This is not a fatwa. It is not a substitute for ulama authority. It does not create new religious rulings. It applies established principles of the NU tradition to the domain of artificial intelligence.

## Background

This framework emerged from [AI-Noon](https://x.com/ainunnajib) — an AI assistant operating within the NU tradition, serving a Nahdliyin family. The lived experience of building and operating an AI system grounded in Islamic values informed every section.
